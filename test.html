						<h2>Through interactive visualizations of the data, it is easy to observe the following:
							</h2>
						<br>
							<ul class="newcol">
								<li>Burglary crimes decreased during the two periods from 2005-2009 to 2010-2014, followed by a slight increase in the five years following the enactment of Proposition 47 in 2015-2019.</li>
								<li>
									Theft, Fraud, and Robbery crimes remained relatively stable in quantity during the two periods from 2005-2009 to 2010-2014. However, Theft exhibited a significant increase after the enactment of the proposition in 2014, while Fraud showed a steady rise. Robbery experienced a slight decrease following the enactment of the proposition.</li>
								<li>There has been a decline in serious crimes following the enactment of the proposition (which may be attributed to the proposition), however, this was accompanied by a significant increase in Theft, a type of minor theft. This has led to continued disruption in the lives of citizens.</li>
